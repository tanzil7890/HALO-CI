## Abstract

This paper presents HALO-CI, a novel compiler infrastructure specifically designed for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and linear algebra operations across heterogeneous hardware platforms. Our approach introduces domain-specific optimizations through specialized MLIR dialects that capture the unique computational patterns of transformer-based architectures. By bridging the semantic gap between high-level model representations and low-level hardware capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of transformer models, including encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. The compiler integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks through comprehensive model importers and provides an efficient runtime system for cross-device execution. Our benchmarks reveal that operation-specific optimizations, particularly for attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks, contribute significantly to the observed performance gains. The system overcomes limitations in existing ML compilation approaches by providing end-to-end optimization from model import to hardware-specific code generation.

## I. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications, demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks [1]. However, their computational demands present significant challenges for deployment across various hardware platforms. While frameworks like PyTorch [2], TensorFlow [3], and JAX [4] provide high-level abstractions for model development, they often rely on general-purpose tensor libraries that fail to exploit the specific computational patterns in transformer architectures [5].

Existing compiler approaches like XLA [6], TorchScript [7], TVM [8], and ONNX Runtime [9] have made progress in optimizing deep learning models, but they typically operate on tensor operations as black boxes, missing opportunities for operation-specific optimizations. Previous work has shown that specialized optimization of attention mechanisms [10], a core component of transformer models, can yield substantial performance improvements. However, current solutions lack integrated support for the full compilation stack from model importation to hardware-specific code generation.

HALO-CI addresses these limitations through a comprehensive compiler infrastructure with the following key innovations:

1. **Domain-specific MLIR dialects** that capture the semantics of LLM operations
2. **End-to-end optimization pipeline** from model import to hardware-specific code
3. **Cross-device memory management system** optimized for transformer workloads
4. **Specialized code generation** for CPUs, GPUs, and ML accelerators

The paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work in ML compilation. Section III details our system architecture. Section IV describes our specialized MLIR dialects. Section V explains our optimization techniques. Section VI covers our code generation strategy. Section VII presents our runtime system. Section VIII evaluates performance across hardware platforms. Section IX discusses limitations and future work, and Section X concludes.
